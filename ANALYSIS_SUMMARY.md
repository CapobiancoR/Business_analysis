## Health Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Exceptional LTV/CAC Ratio**: 12.47x (far exceeds 3x benchmark)
2. **Break-even Achieved**: Month 18 (within 2 years)
3. **Strong Unit Economics**: Sustainable growth model
4. **Improving Retention**: Churn decreases from 6% → 5% over 3 years
5. **Scalable Acquisition**: Social views grow from 895K → 9.46M annually

### ⚠️ Areas of Concern
1. **Capital Target Shortfall**: €1.38M below broker target of €2M
2. **High Churn Rate**: 5-6% monthly (better than B2C average but room for improvement)
3. **Annual Retention**: 54% (implies significant customer replacement needed)
4. **Modest ARR**: €1M by Year 3 may not meet venture-scale expectations

### 💡 Recommendations
1. **Extend Projection**: Model Year 4-5 to show path to €2M capital target
2. **Churn Reduction**: 1% reduction in churn would increase LTV by 20%
3. **Pricing Optimization**: Test higher ARPU tiers for power users
4. **Accelerate Social Views**: Increase content investment to drive organic growth
5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test downside scenarios (±20% conversion, ±1% churn)

## Key Assumptions to Validate

### Critical for Success
1. **3% social view conversion**: Requires strong content-to-traffic funnel
2. **5% visitor-to-signup**: Needs optimized landing pages & CTAs
3. **18% signup-to-paid**: Assumes effective onboarding & value demonstration
4. **Influencer effectiveness**: 300 visitors per collab must be validated
5. **Churn improvement**: 6% → 5% requires product maturity

### Sensitivity Priorities
- **Most Impactful**: Churn rate (directly affects LTV)
- **Second Priority**: Social view conversion (drives top-of-funnel)
- **Third Priority**: Signup-to-paid conversion (affects CAC efficiency)

## Investment Thesis

### For Internal Decision-Making
This model shows a **viable, cash-generating business** with excellent unit economics. The business becomes self-sustaining after 18 months and generates €612K in cumulative cash by Year 3.

**Required Investment**: ~€20K to cover initial 18-month runway

**Expected Return**: 12x+ LTV/CAC suggests every €1 spent on acquisition generates €12+ in customer lifetime value

### For Investor Presentation
The model demonstrates:
- **Product-Market Fit**: Strong conversion rates through the funnel
- **Capital Efficiency**: Low initial investment, fast break-even
- **Scalability**: Social-driven acquisition scales with content
- **Sustainability**: Healthy unit economics with improving trends

**However**, investors seeking venture-scale returns may need:
- Faster growth trajectory (2-3x acceleration)
- Path to €5-10M ARR within 5 years
- Plan to reach €2M+ capital target
- Lower churn rates (target 3-4% monthly)

---

## Conclusion

This is a **fundamentally sound business model** with excellent unit economics (12.5x LTV/CAC) and a clear path to profitability. The business breaks even in 18 months and generates positive cash flow thereafter.

**Best suited for**: Bootstrap, angel, or seed funding (not venture-scale)

**To become venture-ready**: Accelerate growth 3x, reduce churn to 3-4%, and extend projections to show €5M+ ARR path
